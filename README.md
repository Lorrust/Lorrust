**`Class: Digital Artificer`**

<p>I'm a curiosity-driven developer fascinated by the possibilities of technology, as my passion lies in weaving dreams into code. I thrive on building from scratch, appreciating the opportunity to sculpt every line of code. I view the world of technology as a canvas, and I wield languages like brushes, in an attempt of crafting landscapes that push the boundaries of what is possible.</p>

  <summary><h3>🌌 Journey</summary>
    <p>I embarked on my software journey as an inquisitive high school student, captivated by the intricate mechanics of gaming and the logic that surrounded them. With each passing year, my passion for creating experiences that others could enjoy grew stronger. I harnessed this drive to delve into new realms of knowledge, immersing myself in Arduino projects, electronic systems and block-based coding languages like Scratch.</p>
    <p>As my attention drifted towards the field of technology and digital craftsmanship, I found myself studying programming logic and fundamental coding syntaxes. Here, I discovered a world of orderliness, beautifully forged through systematic reasoning and logic. This path allowed me to merge my inherent creativity with the art of problem-solving, breathing life into dreams and concepts.</p>
    <p>Today, I'm currently pursuing a software engineering degree at a renowned university in my region. My studies have led me to explore various facets of coding, particularly those that harmonize logic with creativity. Fueled by my passion for gaming, I have also ventured into the realm of game development, where I am actively developing and refining my ideas into tangible experiences.</p>
