**`Class: Digital Artificer`**

<p>I’m a developer driven by curiosity and a deep passion for turning ideas into reality through code. I love building things from scratch — there’s something incredibly satisfying about shaping every detail and watching it all come together. For me, technology is a creative space, and I see each project as a chance to explore, experiment, and craft something meaningful. Whether it’s a small tool or a big idea, I’m always excited to see where the next line of code will lead.</p>

  <summary><h3>🌌 Journey</summary>
      <p>My journey into software started back in high school, sparked by a fascination with how games work behind the scenes — the logic, the mechanics, all of it. That curiosity quickly turned into a passion for creating experiences that others could enjoy. I started exploring with things like Arduino, electronics, and even block-based languages like Scratch, just to see what I could make.</p>
      <p>As I got deeper into tech, I found myself drawn to the structure and creativity of programming. Learning the basics of logic and syntax opened up a whole new world where I could blend problem-solving with imagination — building things that once only existed in my head.</p> <p>Fast forward to today, I’m studying software engineering at a top university in my region. I’ve had the chance to explore different areas of development, especially where logic and creativity meet. With a strong love for gaming still at my core, I’ve been diving into game development — bringing ideas to life and learning a ton along the way.</p>
